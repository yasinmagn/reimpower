                                <span>Somaliland representative of REIM power consultancy</span>
                                <p>
                                    Mowlid Hassan is a passionate and driven individual with a strong background in humanitarian and development work. With a Master's degree in Project Planning and Management, he has dedicated his career to making a positive impact in Somalia and Somaliland.
                                    In 2022, Mowlid led a baseline assessment for Oxfam to provide a contextual analysis of the voice, influence, and role of women in humanitarian leadership and decision-making. He also conducted capacity needs assessments of women's rights organizations in the Sanaag and Marodijeh regions of Somaliland for the Nagaad Network.

                                    Mowlid has also played a key role in several other projects, including a labor market assessment on future/market-driven skills and investable business opportunities in Burao, Somaliland, commissioned by Candlelight. He was also involved in a youth-led mid-term evaluation of Oxfam's "Work in Progress!" project, which focused on creating economic empowerment opportunities for young people in Somalia.

                                    As a co-lead consultant for Reimpower Consultancy, Mowlid has also contributed to several impactful projects. He was recently engaged by UOH, in partnership with the University of Hargeisa, to translate a national curriculum for childcare and youth development under the "Leave no youth behind" project funded by Danida. Mowlid's team of linguists ensured the curriculum content was accurately translated and culturally adapted for the local context.
                                    Mowlid also led a report writing training for Oxfam-supported local Nexus partners to develop their reporting and story documentation skills, including organizations working on women's economic and social development mandates in humanitarian settings.

                                    Committed to bridging the gap in evidence and knowledge generation in the humanitarian and development sectors, Mowlid uses his expertise to drive positive change in the communities he serves. Over the last three years, he has focused on the MEAL (Monitoring, Evaluation, Accountability, and Learning) sector, working with different INGOs and LNGOs in Hargeisa, Somaliland.
